## The Challenge

Briefly describe the problem: What environmental justice issue were you addressing? Why is it important? (e.g., unequal exposure to pollution, lack of access to green spaces).

## My Approach

Detail your methodology:
- **Data Sources:** What data did you use? (e.g., EPA TRI, Census demographics, satellite imagery, traffic data).
- **Tools & Techniques:** What specific tools (Python libraries like GeoPandas, Rasterio, Scikit-learn) and methods (spatial analysis, regression models, clustering) did you employ?
- **Unique Aspects:** Was there anything novel about your approach? (e.g., combining specific datasets, a custom algorithm).

## Insights & Results

Showcase your findings:
- What were the key results of your analysis? (e.g., identified specific communities disproportionately affected).
- Use visuals if possible (maps, charts - we can embed components later).
- Quantify the impact where possible.

## Impact & Reflection

Discuss the significance:
- What are the potential implications of your findings?
- What did you learn during this project?
- What are potential next steps or future work?
