## The Challenge

*(Content summarizing the problem being solved, e.g., predicting patient outcomes, need for reliable ML in clinical settings)*

...

## My Approach: Data, Features & Modeling

*(Content covering data source (MIMIC-IV), preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection choices - justify decisions)*

...

## MLOps Pipeline & Architecture

*(Detailed description of the MLOps pipeline: e.g., data ingestion, validation, training, deployment, monitoring. Include architecture diagrams using Markdown images or potentially a custom component later)*

...

## Evaluation

*(How the model and pipeline performance were evaluated: metrics, validation strategy)*

...

## Key Findings & Visual Insights

*(Present key results and insights. Interactive charts (Plotly/Apex) will need to be embedded here using custom Client Components)*

**Placeholder for Interactive Chart Component**
```tsx
// Example: <MimicMortalityChart data={...} />
```

...

## Technical Deep Dive

*(Optional/Collapsible section for code snippets, scalability considerations, specific tool configurations. Code blocks will need syntax highlighting)*

**Placeholder for Code Snippet**
```python
# Example Python code
def preprocess_data(df):
    # ... implementation ...
    return df
```

...

## Ethical Considerations

*(Discussion of ethical implications, data privacy, fairness, bias mitigation)*

...

## Limitations & Future Work

*(Acknowledged limitations of the approach and potential future improvements)*
