## The Challenge

Describe the problem: What clinical prediction task were you tackling (e.g., mortality prediction, length-of-stay)? Why is an MLOps approach necessary for this (scalability, reproducibility, monitoring)?

## My Approach: Building the Pipeline

Detail the pipeline stages:
- **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing:** How did you handle the large MIMIC-IV dataset? Feature engineering steps?
- **Model Training & Experiment Tracking:** Which models did you train? How did you track experiments (e.g., MLflow, Weights & Biases)?
- **Model Packaging & Versioning:** How did you package models (e.g., Docker containers)? How was versioning handled?
- **Deployment Strategy:** How were models deployed (e.g., Kubeflow Pipelines, Seldon Core, Vertex AI)? CI/CD integration?
- **Monitoring & Retraining:** How did you plan for monitoring model performance and drift? Retraining triggers?

## Tools & Technologies

List the key technologies used (e.g., Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Docker, Kubernetes, Kubeflow, Airflow, Prometheus, Grafana).

## Results & Evaluation

Present the outcomes:
- How did the final model perform (metrics like AUC, F1-score)?
- What were the benefits of the MLOps pipeline (e.g., faster iteration, improved reliability)?
- Include diagrams of the pipeline architecture if possible.

## Lessons Learned & Future Directions

Reflect on the project:
- What were the main challenges encountered?
- What key MLOps principles did you apply or learn?
- How could the pipeline be further improved?
